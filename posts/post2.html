      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <em>"Mornings in Jenin"</em>, by Palestinian-American author
        <strong>Susan Abulhawa</strong>, is an epic, multi-generational novel
        that brings readers face to face with the tragedy of the Palestinian
        Nakba. The novel spans several decades, telling the story of the
        Abulheja family who are displaced from their village in 1948 and forced
        into the Jenin refugee camp. It is a tale of love, loss, resilience, and
        the search for identity in a land marked by conflict.
      </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        The story begins in <strong>Ein Hod</strong>, a peaceful village, where
        the Abulheja family lives until their lives are shattered during the
        Nakba in 1948. Forced from their home, they move to a refugee camp in
        Jenin, where they experience the harsh realities of displacement. At the
        heart of the novel is <strong>Amal Abulheja</strong>, whose journey from
        childhood to adulthood mirrors the struggles of her people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amal grows up in a world filled with war, loss, and uncertainty. As she
        comes of age, she is separated from her family, witnessing the
        disappearance of her brothers and the death of her loved ones. Despite
        her many tragedies, Amal’s story is also one of survival and strength.
        Through her eyes, readers experience the human cost of the
        Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a cost that is both deeply personal and
        painfully universal.
      </p>

          <strong>Family and Identity:</strong> The novel is a poignant

        <li>
          <strong>Resilience in the Face of Adversity:</strong> Despite their
